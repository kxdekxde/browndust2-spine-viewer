### Buttons:

`Preview`: Open the Spine viewer to see the Spine animation. If the mod folder only contains an image then the viewer will use the user default images viewer to open that image.

`Refresh Mods List`: If you renamed, moved or deleted the mods then use this button to refresh the mods list to show the changes.

`Rename`: Renames your mods folders directly from the GUI.

`Activate/Deactivate`: Deactivate or activate mods, with this function you can have multiple mods for the same character and to activate the one you want to use faster.

`Clear`: Clear the search bar with one click.
